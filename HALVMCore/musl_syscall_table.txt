Subsystem markers:
  NET      -- for implementation by network stacks
  FILE     -- for implementation by file systems
  FILE*    -- for implementation by file systems, but might be skippable
  BOTH     -- things that might affect both file and socket descriptors
  ENOSYS   -- shared across all implementations, probably just ENOSYS
  SHARED   -- shared across all implementations, will require some work
  PLATFORM -- must be implemented by those porting the HaLVM to new platforms 
  CLOCK    -- things that mess with the system clock
  TIMERS   -- things that set timers, because I'm not sure where that goes, yet
  THREADS  -- things are probably going to go in our threading system
  SIGNALS  -- things that deal with signals and signal handling
